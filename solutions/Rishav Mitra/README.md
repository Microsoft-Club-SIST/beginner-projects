### About the Code
* BMI Calculator:
	* It basically takes in the weight and the height which the user inputs, and displays their Body Mass Index (BMI)
	* It is a GUI-based application made with Tkinter

* Caesar Cipher: a really interesting project
	* It has two functions, one to encrypt and the other to decrypt the message
	* The users decide whether they want to encrypt or decrypt their message, type in the message and the shift value, and the program generates the appropriate encrypted/decrypted message
	* This is a command line interface application
